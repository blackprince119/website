<h2>Krabby Patty ($22.99)</h2>
This limited-edition burger features a quarter-pound Wendy's burger, two slices of melted American cheese, all the classic toppings—lettuce, tomato, pickles and onions—and a top-secret Krabby Patty sauce that brings it all together.

<h2>Frosty ($4.99)</h2>
With a consistency that falls somewhere between a milkshake and soft-serve ice cream, the Frosty was created to be eaten with a spoon. But if you prefer to let your Frosty melt a bit to enjoy it with a straw, we won't stop you.
